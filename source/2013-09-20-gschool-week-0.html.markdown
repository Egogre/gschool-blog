Of all the battles a gSchool Ruby SEAL trainee must fight, none is more important than their first â€“ the battle of mind over... well, mind.

gSchool. Despite having only just graduated its first class, it already has a lot of street cred. The emotional euphoria of being accepted into this prestigeous Ruby code school is gone. The good vibe is replaced by its counterpart: PANIC.  

Students are being visited by little demons of self-doubt.

*"What are you doing here?"*

*"You will never make it!"* 

*"Just give up now. Cut your losses and go back to your nice comfortable bed."*

**"Frank will touch you in your bathing suit places!"**

It's our Ruby SEALs "Hell Week" and we have been thrown in the proverbial 'deep end' of learning Ruby programming, fully immersing us with no supplied floatation devices. Why should we not want to save oursleves? In each of our minds is a large bell waiting to be rung, stating that 'we give up. This isn't for me.'

The battle with our short term relief vs. long term benefit is one dealt with individually within our heads, but collectively, we share eachother's pain; for we are all dealing with it in our own ways. We must conquer our self-doubt in order to keep going.

Good news: even though most of us are only barely managing to tread water, none of us has rung that bell.
